# 👋 Hi there, I’m Qinghe Gao!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a **PhD student** in the [Process Intelligence Research](https://www.pi-research.org/) group at the **Delft University of Technology**, supervised by [Artur Schweidtmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/schweidtmann/). My work lies at the intersection of **artificial intelligence** and **chemical engineering**, focusing on:

- 🕹 **Reinforcement Learning**
- 🔗 **Graph Neural Networks**
- 🧬 **Generative Modeling**
- 🧪 **AI for Science**

Beyond research, I’m an avid **boulderer** and **climber** 🧗‍♂️, always seeking new challenges both on the wall and in my projects!
