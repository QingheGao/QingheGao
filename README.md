### Hi there 👋

I’m Qinghe Gao, a PhD student in the [Process Intellgence Research](https://www.pi-research.org/) at the Delft University of Technology supervised by [Artur Schweidtmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/schweidtmann/). My research focuses on artificial intelligence in chemical enginnering :hammer_and_wrench::robot:, but I am also interested in generative modeling:atom_symbol:, reinforcement learning 🕹, AI4Science 🧪. Besides that, I like bouldering and climbing :climbing_man:.


### Research

- 📚[Modeling Category-Selective Cortical Regions with Topographic Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13911) - **Best paper award**: *NeurIPS 2021 Workshop SVRHM* : We leverage the newly introduced Topographic Variational Autoencoder to model of the emergence of such localized category-selectivity in an unsupervised manner.
- 📚[Flowsheet synthesis through hierarchical reinforcement learning and graph neural networks](https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/aic.17938) - *AICHE*: Weproposeareinforcementlearningalgorithmforchemicalprocess designbasedonastate-of-the-artactor-criticlogic.
- 📚[Graph neural networks for the prediction of molecular structure-property relationships](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04852.pdf) - *Royal Society Chemistry - Book chapter*): We describe the fundamentals of GNNs and demonstrate the application of GNNs via two examples for molecular property prediction.
